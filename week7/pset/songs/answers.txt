-> If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura? We can specify it on their genres and moods.

-> Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose? because maybe the listener need a smaller ducration song or a longer one or maybe something to do with the artist.
