The answer to the first question:
Initially, I am planning to adopt a similar approach to Spotify's Wrapped feature, which involves creating a summary of users' listening habits.
However, instead of representing them using colors, I would consider using names inspired by elements of nature or similar concepts.

The answer to the second question:
This system may encounter challenges because some Spotify listeners have multiple tastes in music, which can cause collisions in the system (hash talking).
To prevent these collisions, I propose using more entities or colors to improve the accuracy of personalization.
Although this approach may require additional storage space, it is considered the optimal solution.
